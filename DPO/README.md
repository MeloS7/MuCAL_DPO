# DPO Part

This is Direct Preerence Optimisation part in our paper. 

We follow the standard DPO pipeline (pre-trained -> SFT-> DPO), thus, we provide a full fine-tuning (Instruction-Tuning) script and a DPO-tuning script.

The data is all about the generations from few-shot, IT, DPO models with different backbones.
